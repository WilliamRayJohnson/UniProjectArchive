Problem 1
(1) If you enter a name longer than 10 characters, when the sentence is outputed, it will only output the first 10 characters. To modify this one would
only have to change the 10 where MyName was defined to a larger number.
(2) Some funny characters appeared after the name and there was white space after it.
(3) I am guessing since it was not defined how long that particular string would be with that word put in, that string had a length of 10 since it was 
defined as that earlyer and there where some characters in that string defaultly.

Problem 2
(1) I believe there is default amount of space an interger takes up. Since the year was not enough characters to fill up that default space, the remaining
space became whitespace.
(2) I get an error.
(3) If you enter a year outside the range you get an error and the program ends.
