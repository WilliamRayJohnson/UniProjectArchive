Lab 5 William Ray Johnson
1. The subprogram is named Maximum
It has 3 parameters
One local variable: Largest
The output of 1 and 2 is "The maximum of 1 and 2 is 2"
The output of 10 and 5 is "The maximum of 10 and 5 is 10."

2. Error is "formal parameter "A" is read but never assigned. This means that A exsist but it is not assigned any value. This makes sense 
since orginially this parameter was getting its assignment as an input for maximum.

3.The output is "The maximum of 4350708 and 2 is 4350708" Since A was made an output, when 1 and 2 are typed in A is not assigned anything.
Instead the default value of an integer is kept. I am guessing that 4350708 is the maximum number an integer can hold.

4.It says that assignment to "in" mode parameter not allowed. Every procedure needs an output, it is saying this because 
there is no output parameter.

5. The maximum of MaxX and MaxY is the maximum value of Value1, Value2, Value3, and Value4.
